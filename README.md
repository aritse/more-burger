# Burger (Sequel)

### Overview

This is a burger app that I am creating to practice Sequelize. This app can be used to track customers and burger orders.

* Customer model is associated to the burger model. The association is such that a customer has many burgers and a burger belongs to one customer. The app logs the name of customer along with the burgers that they ate.

### Tools and Concepts Covered
* Heroku to deploy the app
* MySQL to store data
* Sequelize Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to create models
* Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm to modulize the app
* Handlebars.JS NPM package as template engine to generate dynamic content from DB
* Node.JS
* Express.JS
* Separation of Concerns
* Association
* Bootstrap CSS Framework
